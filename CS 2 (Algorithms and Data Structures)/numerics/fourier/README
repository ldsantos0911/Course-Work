The fourier transform transforms from time coordinates to frequency coordinates.
A normal sine wave has two frequency, a positive and negative one. Therefore, a
normal fourier transform will consist of a line pointing in the positive y direction
and the negative y direction, to represent the two present frequencies. I would
expect the discrete transform to have two positive lines, for it will only detect
one frequency, not gleaning its sign from the data supplied.

As the function becomes more and more complicated, the fourier transform will
become more and more complicated, for it will represent more and more present
frequencies.
