The Backward Euler:
The backward method energy decreases and the planet spirals into the star it is
orbiting. This is not accurate.
q
The Forward Euler:
The forward method energy increases and the planet slowly spirals farther and
farther away from the star. This is not accurate either.

The Symplectic Euler:
The symplectic method maintains relatively constant energy and the planet maintains
a relatively consistent elliptical orbit. This is the most accurate representation.
