Game of Life v1.0:

This is a personal project of mine to play and visualize Conway's Game of Life.

At present, the only feature this implementation incorporates is the ability to
use a few different themes for the game of life.

One runs the program by typing:

$python3 gol.py [cool|warm|mono]

Features that will hopefully be added in the future:
- Reading initial board state from file (underway)
- Stopping and starting with a keypress
- Controls in window to change settings
- More intuitive size alterations
- Automatically rotating desktop backgrounds for Mac OS, so that your desktop
  can be the game of life.
