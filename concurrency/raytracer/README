It is more efficient to use an approach similar to a producer-consumer queue, for
it ensures a more even distribution of computation required per thread. If all of
the rays are put into a queue and all of the threads work on that queue simultaneously,
consuming a roughly equal amount of the queue, the threads will perform
roughly equal amounts of work. This normalizes the amount of time each thread takes,
decreasing the total time of the overall computation (which would have otherwise
equaled the time taken by the thread with the most complex rendering).
