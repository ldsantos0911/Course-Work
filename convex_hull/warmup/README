I programmed in c++. In order to run this program, type the following commands.

$ make linked_list
$ ./linked_list

This uses the List created in linked_list.cpp along with the List class and Node
struct which I moved to a separate file.

This only works with a List object which allows access to its first node and
size, and a Node struct which is public.

COMPLEXITY:
This algorithm has time efficiency O(n) and space efficiency O(1).
