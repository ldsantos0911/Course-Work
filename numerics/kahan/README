The imprecision in the naive summation is an effect of adding an extremely small
number to 1. Addition to a double is not precise enough to accommodate the
addition of values as small as 10^-8. 10^-8 is rounded out after each addition,
so each addition of 10^-8 does not accumulate if naively added.
